# places

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a system that displays the business and general vibe of the clubs/bars in NYC (as well as other cities in the future). I'm hoping to host it on my website micahgray.me at some point once I have a version that I like - that way other people can suggest places to list.

This project will most likely need to be behind a paywall since the API itself will cost me pretty heavily.
